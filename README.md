SH , CSH , KSH 

LINUX: GNU
    BASH - Born/ Bourne Again shell ( SH + KSH + CSH)
    
    BASH is default in Linux OS 
    
ZSH -> End User friendly

Linux OS does not require an extension like .sh , We keep it for our understanding.

Again for BASH in Linux, We can use either .sh or .bash (Again it is for you to determine what it is, But not for OS)
